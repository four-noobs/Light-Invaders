# Light-Invaders
How to run:
  - make sure you have pygame installed: https://www.pygame.org/news
  - run main.py
  - controls are w,a,s,d, and space to use the shield
  - getting hit by enemies and meteors slows you down,
  - the yellow orbs speed you up
  - stay ahead of the approaching black hole
  - have fun :)
